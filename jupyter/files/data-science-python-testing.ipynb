Testing lets you know that your code is correct in many situations that matter to you.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"comment\" style=\"border: 2px solid #ffecc1; margin: 1em 0.2em\">\n<div class=\"box-title comment-title\" id=\"comment\"><i class=\"far fa-comment-dots\" aria-hidden=\"true\" ></i> Comment</div>\n<p>This tutorial is significantly based on <a href=\"https://carpentries.org\">the Carpentries</a> lesson <a href=\"https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/\">“Intermediate Research Software Development”</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Being able to demonstrate that a process generates the right results is important in any field of research, whether it’s software generating those results or not. So when writing software we need to ask ourselves some key questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the code we develop work the way it should do?</li>\n<li>Can we (and others) verify these assertions for themselves?</li>\n<li>Perhaps most importantly, to what extent are we confident of the accuracy of results that appear in publications?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we are unable to demonstrate that our software fulfills these criteria, why would anyone use it? Having well-defined tests for our software are useful for this, but manually testing software can prove an expensive process.</p>\n<p>Automation can help, and automation where possible is a good thing - it enables us to define a potentially complex process in a repeatable way that is far less prone to error than manual approaches. Once defined, automation can also save us a lot of effort, particularly in the long run. In this episode we’ll look into techniques of automated testing to improve the predictability of a software change, make development more productive, and help us produce code that works as expected and produces desired results.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"agenda\" style=\"border: 2px solid #86D486;display: none; margin: 1em 0.2em\">\n<div class=\"box-title agenda-title\" id=\"agenda\">Agenda</div>\n<p>In this tutorial, we will cover:</p>\n<ol id=\"markdown-toc\">\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-software-testing\" id=\"markdown-toc-what-is-software-testing\">What Is Software Testing?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#example-codebase\" id=\"markdown-toc-example-codebase\">Example Codebase</a></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-software-testing\">What Is Software Testing?</h2>\n<p>For the sake of argument, if each line we write has a 99% chance of being right, then a 70-line program will be wrong more than half the time. We need to do better than that, which means we need to test our software to catch these mistakes.</p>\n<p>We can and should extensively test our software manually, and manual testing is well-suited to testing aspects such as graphical user interfaces and reconciling visual outputs against inputs. However, even with a good test plan, manual testing is very time consuming and prone to error. Another style of testing is automated testing, where we write code that tests the functions of our software. Since computers are very good and efficient at automating repetitive tasks, we should take advantage of this wherever possible.</p>\n<p>There are three main types of automated tests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unit tests</strong> are tests for fairly small and specific units of functionality, e.g. determining that a particular function returns output as expected given specific inputs.</li>\n<li><strong>Functional or integration tests</strong> work at a higher level, and test functional paths through your code, e.g. given some specific inputs, a set of interconnected functions across a number of modules (or the entire code) produce the expected result. These are particularly useful for exposing faults in how functional units interact.</li>\n<li><strong>Regression tests</strong> make sure that your program’s output hasn’t changed, for example after making changes your code to add new functionality or fix a bug.</li>\n<li><strong>Property tests</strong> are an advanced testing strategy to find corner cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the purposes of this course, we’ll focus on unit tests. But the principles and practices we’ll talk about can be built on and applied to the other types of tests too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example-codebase\">Example Codebase</h2>\n",
