    questions:
      - How are biodiversity related data and environmental data processed, combined and analyzed?
      - What are the expected distribution of species in space and/ro in time?
    objectives:
      - Import biodiversity datasets from databanks like GBIF or ALA
      - Import evironmental data as Worldclim
      - Combine biodiversity and environmental data through modelization
      - Predict time/space distribution of species
    requirements:
    time_estimation: "1h"
    key_points:
      - Sophisticated analysis of biodiversity data is possible using tools hosted by Galaxy-E.
      - Ecological dataset analyses require multiple methods of preprocess to ensure that the data are appropriate for answering the biology question of interest.
      - By using the sharable and transparent Galaxy platform, data analyses can easily be shared and reproduced.

    questions:
      - How is raw ChIP-seq data processed and analyzed?
      - What are the binding sites of the Estrogen receptor?
    objectives:
      - Inspect read quality with FastQC
      - Map reads with Bowtie2
      - Assess the quality of an ChIP-seq experiments
      - Extract coverage files
      - Call enriched regions or peaks
    time_estimation: "3h"
    key_points:
      - ChIP-seq data requires multiple methods of quality assessment to ensure that the data is of high quality.
      - Multiple normalization methods exists depending on the availability of input data.
      - Heatmaps containing all genes of an organism can be easily plotted given a BED file and a coverage file.

    summary: "Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology and conservation. Presence-only SDMs such as MaxEnt frequently use natural history collections (NHCs) as occurrence data, given their huge numbers and accessibility. NHCs are often spatially biased which may generate inaccuracies in SDMs. Here, we test how the distribution of NHCs and MaxEnt predictions relates to a spatial abundance model using inverse distance weighting (IDW"
