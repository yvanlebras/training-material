This gives you more control over both how the GTN looks, and works, for you.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>

<p>This will allow users to set their theme with some more granularity! Previously
you could only choose between a few themes, now these have been split into
separate axes giving you more control over how the GTN renders for you.</p>

<h3 id="brightness">Brightness</h3>

<p>Previously you could switch manually between light and dark themes. Now the GTN
will default to an automatic one that switches the GTN to dark mode when your
system preferences requests it.
Alternatively you can override this and choose a light or dark theme as you prefer.</p>

<h3 id="light-theme">Light Theme</h3>

<p>We’ve added a new light theme with a more yellowed background to be less harsh
on the eyes. When the GTN is using the light mode (automatically or manually)
you can toggle between this and the plain white version.</p>

<h3 id="dark-theme">Dark Theme</h3>

<p>Likewise, now when the GTN is using the dark mode (automatically or manually)
you can choose whether it will use the “night” (dark grey) or “midnight” (pure black) themes.</p>

<h3 id="contrast">Contrast</h3>

<p>Have you ever tried to use some applications in high-light environments, such
as outdoors and found them hard to read? Many websites use unfortunately low
contrast. The GTN now has a slider that allows you to select low, normal
(automatic), or high contrast as is your preference. High contrast will make
all elements a bit more contrasting to ensure you can see them more easily in
those environments.</p>

<h3 id="themes-1">Themes!</h3>

<p>Previously if you wanted the Halloween theme it would only exist on a dark
background, but now you can try them out on any background! The same goes for
all other GTN themes, so please feel free to choose whatever colours suit you,
knowing you’ll be able to use the GTN day and night.</p>

<h2 id="data-privacy">Data Privacy</h2>

<p>The GTN collects very limited information on you as a person. Most of our
developers are located in the EU, and live under GDPR. We do not want your personal data at all.</p>

<p>However we do collect very limited statistics (page views), and error logs via
Sentry (whenever errors occur). If you wish to opt-out of this collection, you

The GTN has you covered with the Pan-Galactic Tool Search that is now available.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: the authors were reminded of
<a href="https://galaxycat.france-bioinformatique.fr/">GalaxyCat</a> which does the same
thing as the GTN but better! Please go use that.</p>

<hr />

<p>We recently received a question online from our colleague <a href="https://github.com/scottcain">Dr. Scott Cain</a>
trying to find the <em>Manta</em> Structural Variant analysis tool amongst the Galaxies. While
his complaints about generic names are very apt (and Galaxy existed before the
phone!) we do still have very generic names in our tools.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is also quite difficult with these large, complex,
JavaScript based web applications. So, the GTN has added a Pan Galactic Tool
Search!</p>

<iframe src="https://genomic.social/@scottcain/110498601155255378/embed" width="100%" height="250">
Scott: Arg! Please don't use common words to name your software projects! First (and a long time ago) you have the fine folks @galaxyproject using that word, then you have the SV caller Manta, making it impossible to answer with a simple google whether manta is available at a public Galaxy hub.
</iframe>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>

<p>The GTN uses the list of <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/use/">Public Galaxy
Servers</a> available from the Hub to construct
the dropdowns you see on Tutorials indicating which servers support a given
tutorial.</p>

<p>Every time the GTN gets deployed (at minimum once a day), we collect a list of
tools that are available from each of those servers. This metadata is available
directly from the GTN (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api/psl.json</code>).</p>

<p>When we render a tutorial, we check the list of tools used in that tutorial,
both those annotated by authors, as well as whichever ones are mentioned in the
associated workflows, and list the intersection of what’s available.</p>

<p>Since we had this metadata already available, it was trivial to generate a tool
search which simply searches through this file and lists the relevant servers.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>As the GTN is a static site, so is our search. It takes a second to load the
tool search interface (~7MB uncompressed), but after that you can search more
or less instantaneously through all 15k versions of the 6k known tools we see
across the Galaxy.</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="gtn" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you ever want to run a tool, but not know where it might be available?

We have automatically activated the new Progress Pride theme on the home page (<a href="#" onclick="setTheme('progress')">Click to Activate</a>) if you hadn’t already selected a theme.</p>

<p>This month we want to highlight the contributions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_L._Hart">Alan L. Hart</a>, an American physician and radiologist who pioneered the use of X-Rays to screen for Tuberculosis. Dr. Hart was one of the first trans men to have a hysterectomy in the US.</p>

<h2 id="tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</h2>

<p>Tuberculosis, mostly caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"><em>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</em></a>, is 13<sup>th</sup> leading cause of death. It was temporarily decreased to the 2<sup>nd</sup> leading cause of death by an infectious agent, due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Sadly, it retains this position despite being preventable and curable (<span class="citation"><a href="#who_tuberculosis_2023">WHO 2023</a></span>).</p>

<p>Roughly 23% of the world’s population is infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, it claims 1.5 million lives each year (<span class="citation"><a href="#cdc_tuberculosis_2020">CDC 2020</a></span>).</p>

<h2 id="alan-l-hart">Alan L. Hart</h2>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>Hart graduated from Albany College in 1912, and in 1917 obtained a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Oregon Medical Department in Portland (now Oregon Health &amp; Science University);
[…]
Hart devoted much of his career to research into and treatment of tuberculosis. In the early 20th century the disease was the biggest killer in America. … Hart was among the first physicians to document how it then spread, via the circulatory system, causing lesions on the kidneys, spine, and brain, eventually resulting in death
[…]
In the early twentieth century [X-Rays] were used to detect bone fractures and tumors, but Hart became interested in their potential for detecting tuberculosis. Since the disease often presented no symptoms in its early stages, x-ray screening was invaluable for early detection.</p>

  <p>In 1937 Hart was hired by the Idaho Tuberculosis Association and later became the state’s Tuberculosis Control Officer. He established up Idaho’s first fixed-location and mobile TB screening clinics and spearheaded the state’s war against tuberculosis. Between 1933 and 1945 Hart traveled extensively through rural Idaho, covering thousands of miles while lecturing, conducting mass TB screenings, training new staff, and treating the effects of the epidemic.</p>

  <p>An experienced and accessible writer, Hart wrote widely for medical journals and popular publications, describing TB for technical and general audiences and giving advice on its prevention, detection, and cure. At the time the word “tuberculosis” carried a social stigma akin to venereal disease, so Hart insisted his clinics be referred to as “chest clinics”, himself as a “chest doctor”, and his patients as “chest patients”. Discretion and compassion were important tools in treating the stigmatised disease.</p>

  <p>In 1943 Hart, now recognised as preeminent in the field of tubercular Roentgenology, compiled his extensive evidence on TB and other x-ray-detectable cases into a definitive compendium, <em>These Mysterious Rays: A Nontechnical Discussion of the Uses of X-rays and Radium, Chiefly in Medicine</em> (pub. Harper &amp; Brothers), still a standard text today. The book was translated into several languages, including Spanish.</p>

<h1 id="new-galaxy-training-genome-wide-alternative-splicing-analysis">New Galaxy training: Genome-wide alternative splicing analysis</h1>

<p>Isoform switching is a biological phenomenon that plays a crucial role in the regulation and diversity of gene expression. It refers to the process by which alternative splicing of pre-mRNA generates different mRNA isoforms that can produce distinct protein products under different conditions. Despite the fact that alternative splicing has been demonstrated to play a fundamental roles in a wide range of biological contexts, such as tissue-specific expression, disease development and evolutionary adaptation, isoform-based expression anaysis pipelines are still rare when compared with gene-level quantification studies.</p>

<p>This new Galaxy training explores the isoform switching concept and provides a step-by-step guide for analyzing this regulatory mechanism. It makes use of <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR.html">IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR</a>, a R package which integrates a multi-step analysis for isoform detection and functional prediction.</p>

<p><a href="/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%; margin:auto;"><img src="/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" alt="Overview of computational pipeline for isoform detection and functional prediction." width="1071" height="779" loading="lazy" />&lt;figcaption&gt;<span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Adapted from Vitting-Seerup et Sandelin, 2017.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</figure></a></p>

<p>A second important aspect of this pipeline is that it allows to evaluate alternative splicing at two different levels: gene-specific and genome-wide scale. This dual-approach allows not only to indentify specific genes, but also prividing an analytical instrument for the study of genome-wide regulatory networks. Finally, a third important element of this training, directly derived from the operational capabilities of IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR, is that it allows to integrate multiple layers of information in the analysis. Concretely, in order to evaluate the functional consequences of the isoform switching events, IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR allows to integrate information bout coding-potential, protein-domains, signal peptides and instrinsically disordered regions.</p>]]></content><author><name>Cristóbal Gallardo</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new tutorial" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GTN hosts a new training for analyzing alternative splicing at genome-wide scale!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/images/isoform_usage_post.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">BY-COVID and RO-Crate collaboration brings new topic: FAIR Data, Workflows &amp;amp; More</title><link href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="BY-COVID and RO-Crate collaboration brings new topic: FAIR Data, Workflows &amp;amp; More" /><published>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/news/2023/05/11/ro-crate.html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the BY-COVID project, the RO-Crate team and BY-COVID members have

<p>So we have built a similar service for the GTN:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You write a URL like <a href="https://my.galaxy.training/?path=/workflows/list">https://my.galaxy.training/?path=/workflows/list</a></li>
  <li>A user visits this URL</li>
  <li>They’re asked for which Galaxy server is their ‘home’ server</li>
  <li>They will be redirected to that path, on that server, e.g. https://usegalaxy.eu/workflows/list</li>
</ol>

<p>We will be using this to implement a ‘button’ that users can click to directly import a workflow on their home server, and as a fallback for the “Click to Run” tools enabled by Tutorial Mode.</p>

<p>Additionally there is a <a href="https://my.gat.galaxy.training">my.gat.galaxy.training</a> which provides the same service for the Galaxy Admin Training workshop series. There we will use this feature to link admins directly to the VM they are working on when they’re working through the training and we need them to e.g. see something in their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/admin</code> page or in their tool data tables.</p>

<h2 id="potential-uses">Potential Uses</h2>

<p>Regardless of which server a user will use, in the cloud or locally, you can now link to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tools</li>
  <li>Galaxy UI pages:
    <ul>
      <li>Workflow editor</li>
      <li>Workflow import</li>
      <li>TRS import</li>
      <li>Visualisations</li>
      <li>etc!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="try-them-out">Try them out</h2>

<p>Both of these services can be used from today onwards!</p>

One click, will get you into Galaxy with a workflow imported and ready to run.
If you are on either usegalaxy.org or usegalaxy.eu, we have implemented easy buttons which you can click that will direct you straight to your Galaxy server.</p>

<p>Clicking a single button will bring you directly into the associated Galaxy interface, with the workflow loaded into your account, and ready to run.</p>

<p>We have additionally added a ‘generic’ method by which you can launch workflows on your preferred server via a redirect.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-magic-work">How does the magic work?</h2>

<p>In the backend the GTN has implemented very limited support for the GA4GH TRS API. Galaxy has support for loading and running workflows directly from compatible endpoints which we leverage to enable this cool feature. You can read more in the <a href="/training-material/api/index.html">GTN API</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="gtn" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The GTN has implemented “click to run” workflows!

Now we have started the process of fully documenting the functions and modules available to GTN developers.</p>

<p>Our library of liquid filters, and functions that we use throughout the GTN, can be found at <a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/gtn_rdoc/">the GTN Rdoc page</a>. For example many of our filters are available in <a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/gtn_rdoc/Jekyll/GtnFunctions.html">Jekyll::GtnFunctions</a></p>

<p>This documentation is a work in progress but will improve over time, as we hopefully consolidate and clean up our function library into a more useful “GTN” module.</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="gtn" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The internal functions of the GTN have, in the past, not been very well documented.
