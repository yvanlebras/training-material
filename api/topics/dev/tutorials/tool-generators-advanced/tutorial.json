  "key_points": [
    "The ToolFactory Appliance includes an automated form driven tool generator.",
    "It produces new tools as Toolshed ready archives",
    "It was designed for scientists and developers who routinely write scripts for their analyses.",
    "It can quickly turn a working command line script into a working Galaxy tool.",
    "It generates tools from information entered on a Galaxy form in the familiar UI.",
    "The new tool is installed in the appliance after generation so can be used and explored immediately.",
    "New tools can be adjusted as needed by re-running the job that generated the tool and updating the form settings to suit.",
    "Adding a test to the toolshed archive takes a minute or so and is only needed when the new tool is ready to export for sharing.",
    "Experimenting with the ToolFactory samples will help acquire insight and skills useful for manual tool building."
