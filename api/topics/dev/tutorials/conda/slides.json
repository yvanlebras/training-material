  "key_points": [
    "Conda and Bioconda are Galaxy best practices for connecting Galaxy tools to underlying applications and libraries.",
    "Leveraging Conda allows easy installation of your tool's dependencies by Galaxy deployers.",
    "The Planemo commands `conda_search`, `conda_init`, `conda_install`, `lint`, `test`, and `serve` make it easy to search and use existing Conda recipes when developing tools.",
    "Conda recipe skeletons, `conda build`, and with `planemo conda_install --conda_use_local` allow easy development of new Conda recipes at the same time as Galaxy tools that wrap them.",
    "Bioconda is a Galaxy best practice Conda channel for recipe publication.",
    "Bioconda has easy to follow contribution guidelines and is very welcoming to new contributors."
