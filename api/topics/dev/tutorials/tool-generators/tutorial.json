  "key_points": [
    "The ToolFactory is an automated Galaxy tool generator for scientists and developers who routinely write command line scripts.",
    "It can turn a working command line script into a proper Galaxy tool with a test in a few minutes.",
    "It automatically generates simple, complete Galaxy tools from information provided by filling in a normal Galaxy form in the familiar UI.",
    "It is installed as a self-configuring development code clone.",
    "The Galaxy server is suited any modern Linux workstation or high-end laptop.",
    "Useful for learning about system administration or framework code, and for developing tools - all on your own private pop-up server."
  ],
  "objectives": [
    "Learn why you might want to use the ToolFactory development server",
    "Watch a video demonstration and explore the generated code - Hello Galaxy Training Network!",
    "Run it locally in Docker.",
    "Install and explore the simple examples provided.",
    "Modify and re-generate them to see how the changes affect the tool",
    "Generate new simple Galaxy tools using your own scripts"
  ],
  "questions": [
    "What options exist for new-to-Galaxy developers to convert functioning command line scripts into Galaxy tools?",
    "Can any command line script I've written be wrapped as a Galaxy tool?",
    "How can I get the ToolFactory working locally, since you tell me it should never be exposed on a public server?",
    "What is the difference between a hand-crafted tool and a ToolFactory generated one?"
