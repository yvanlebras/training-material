    "A relational database stores information in tables, each of which has a fixed set of columns and a variable number of records.",

    "Use SELECT... FROM... to get values from a database table.",
    "SQL is case-insensitive (but data is case-sensitive).",
    "The records in a database table are not intrinsically ordered: if we want to display them in some order, we must specify that explicitly with ORDER BY.",
    "The values in a database are not guaranteed to be unique: if we want to eliminate duplicates, we must specify that explicitly as well using DISTINCT.",
    "Use WHERE to specify conditions that records must meet in order to be included in a query's results.",
    "Use AND, OR, and NOT to combine tests.",
    "Filtering is done on whole records, so conditions can use fields that are not actually displayed.",

    "Use UNION to combine the results of two or more queries.",
    "Databases use a special value called NULL to represent missing information.",
    "Almost all operations on NULL produce NULL.",
    "Queries can test for NULLs using IS NULL and IS NOT NULL."
