    "Use SELECT... FROM... to get values from a database table.",
    "SQL is case-insensitive (but data is case-sensitive).",
    "The records in a database table are not intrinsically ordered: if we want to display them in some order, we must specify that explicitly with ORDER BY.",
    "The values in a database are not guaranteed to be unique: if we want to eliminate duplicates, we must specify that explicitly as well using DISTINCT.",
    "Use WHERE to specify conditions that records must meet in order to be included in a query's results.",

    "Filtering is done on whole records, so conditions can use fields that are not actually displayed.",

    "Use UNION to combine the results of two or more queries.",
    "Databases use a special value called NULL to represent missing information.",
    "Almost all operations on NULL produce NULL.",
    "Queries can test for NULLs using IS NULL and IS NOT NULL."
