  "key_points": [
    "Make and Snakemake are ways to write pipelines in a declarative format",
    "Instead of writing individual actions you wish to take, you describe how to produce each file you need, and the system executes those steps only if they're needed",
    "If you're doing scientific research you should use Snakemake",
    "Snakemake can significantly speed up your command line pipelines by providing automatic detection of inputs, and not re-creating them if they don't need",
    "Snakemake also provides very easy access to paralellisation without complexity.",
    "But it is more complex than using Galaxy"
