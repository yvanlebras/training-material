    "Learn how RNA-seq reads are converted into counts",
    "Understand QC steps that can be performed on RNA-seq reads",
    "Generate interactive reports to summarise QC information with MultiQC",

  "time_estimation": "3h",
  "key_points": [
    "In RNA-seq, reads (FASTQs) are mapped to a reference genome with a spliced aligner (e.g HISAT2, STAR)",
    "The aligned reads (BAMs) can then be converted to counts",
    "Many QC steps can be performed to help check the quality of the data",
    "MultiQC can be used to create a nice summary report of QC information",
    "The Galaxy Rule-based Uploader, Collections and Workflows can help make analysis more efficient and easier"
