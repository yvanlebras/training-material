    "How is raw CLIP-Seq data processed and analysed?",
    "How do I find binding motifs and targets for a protein (e.g., RBFOX2)?"

  "objectives": [
    "Remove Adapters, Barcodes and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) from the reads",
    "Align trimmed reads with STAR",
    "De-duplicate the read library",
    "Inspect the read mapping and de-duplication quality",

  "key_points": [
    "Sophisticated analysis of CLIP-Seq data is possible using tools hosted by Galaxy.",
    "Analysis of the datasets needs multiple methods to assess the quality of the data and to answer the biological question of interest.",
    "CLIP-Seq data varies from protocol to protocol, thus flexible changes to the data anylsis are required which is supported by Galaxy.",
    "By using the sharable and transparent Galaxy platform, data analyses can easily be shared and reproduced."
