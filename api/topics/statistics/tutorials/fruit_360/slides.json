      "description": "The classification of fruits and vegetables offers many useful applications such as automated harvesting by robots, building up stocks for supermarkets, effective detection of specific defects, and determining fruit ripeness (Duong et al. 2020, Naranjo-Torres et al. 2020, Iswari et al. 2017). Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as Deep Learning (DL) are commonly used for image classification problems in various domains, including in agriculture (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú 2018). DL is a technique inspired by how a human brain operates. Due to the increased availability of compute capacity and training data, DL techniques have become very popular in recent years. In this tutorial, we will use Galaxy’s ML toolkit to build a DL model to classify fruit and vegetable images. Our DL model is trained and evaluated on Fruit 360 dataset (Mureşan and Oltean 2018)\n",
