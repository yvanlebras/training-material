    "Sequence comparison is difficult due to its computational complexity and the growth of databases",
    "There are several approaches to sequencen comparison, and we need to know which one to use (DP-based, alignment-free, seeds, etc.)",
    "We have learnt the internals regarding GECKO, GECKO-MGV and CHROMEISTER to work with single chromosome comparisons and/or exhaustive searchs, the post-processing and for larger/noisy experiments, respectively"
